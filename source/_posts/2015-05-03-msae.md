### Introduction

Multi-modal retrieval is emerging as a new search paradigm that enables
seamless information retrieval from various types of media. For example,
users can simply snap a movie poster to sear ch relevant reviews and trailers.
To solve the problem, a set of map- ping functions are learned to project
high-dimensional features extracted from data of different media types into
a common low- dimensional space so that metric distance measures can be ap
plied.  In this paper, we propose an effective mapping mechanism bas ed on deep
learning (i.e., stacked auto-encoders) for multi-modal retrieval. Mapping
functions are learned by optimizing a new objective function, which captures
both intra-modal and inter-modal semantic relationships of data from
heterogeneous sources effectively. Compared with previous works which require
a substantial amount of prior knowledge such as similarity matrices o f
intra- modal data and ranking examples, our method requires little prior
knowledge. Given a large training dataset, we split it into mini-batches and
continually adjust the mapping functions for ea ch batch of input. Hence, our
method is memory efficient with respect to the data volume. Experiments on
three real datasets illustrate that our proposed method achieves significant
improvement in search accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods
