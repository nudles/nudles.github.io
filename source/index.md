I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore (NUS). I got my B.S. from Renmin University of China in 2011 and PhD from NUS in 2017. My research interests include deep learning systems and applications for multimedia data. I am currently working on (distributed) deep learning system optimization and multi-modal data analysis for image retrieval.
