I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore (NUS). I got my B.S. from Renmin University of China in 2011 and PhD from NUS in 2017. My research interests include machine learning system optimizations and multimedia applications. I am currently working on automated machine learning systems, and machine learning for malware detection.
